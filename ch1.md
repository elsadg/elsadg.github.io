<h2>Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Key Concepts and Sensors</h2>

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) are active sensors that operate in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (cm to dm wavelength) (Bamler & Hartl, 1998) (Figure 1). As active sensors, they transmit their own signal, and thus are independent of solar illumination and are unaffected by most meteorological conditions, with longer wavelengths having the ability to fully penetrate cloud and haze (Oliver & Quegan, 2004; Woodhouse, 2005). This characteristic makes them highly suitable for use in the tropics, where almost constant cloud cover in places greatly hinders the acquisition of optical remote sensing data. Operational monitoring of tropical forests can, therefore, only be accomplished using SAR systems. One more advantage of spaceborne SAR systems is that they are able to view extensive areas.
