<h3>Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Interferometric SAR (InSAR): Key Concepts, Sensors and Data Analysis Methods</h3>


<h2>Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Key Concepts and Sensors</h2>

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) are active sensors that operate in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (cm to dm wavelength) (Bamler & Hartl, 1998) (Figure 1). As active sensors, they transmit their own signal, and thus are independent of solar illumination and are unaffected by most meteorological conditions, with longer wavelengths having the ability to fully penetrate cloud and haze (Oliver & Quegan, 2004; Woodhouse, 2005). This characteristic makes them highly suitable for use in the tropics, where almost constant cloud cover in places greatly hinders the acquisition of optical remote sensing data. Operational monitoring of tropical forests can, therefore, only be accomplished using SAR systems. One more advantage of spaceborne SAR systems is that they are able to view extensive areas.
SAR systems send microwave pulses towards the Earth's surface looking sideways at an angle from the normal to the ground (incidence angle) (Figure 1). It is a ranging device, measuring the distance to an object by time of flight. Spatial resolution in range is dictated by the duration of the pulse. Each pulse illuminates in the range direction a portion of the ground called the swath, while the satellite moves in a direction called cross-range or azimuth. For each pulse, a portion of the radiation is scattered back to the sensor where it is detected. The returned signals, each containing a common portion of the illuminated ground, are combined to construct the equivalent of an observation provided by a virtual long antenna composed by each position of the satellite along the azimuth direction. It is through this process, called synthetic aperture formation, that much higher resolution in the azimuth direction can be obtained with respect to the resolution afforded by a single physical antenna.
The SAR sensor in imaging mode measures the normalised radar cross section for each resolution element (backscattering coefficient usually expressed in dB). The backscattering coefficient can be higher if the energy is backscattered towards the radar (e.g. urban areas which appear white) while, it can be lower if the energy is directed away from the sensor (e.g. in the case of smooth surfaces like water which appears black) (Moreira, et al., 2013) (Figure 2).
The amount of scatter depends on the physical and electrical properties of the target on the ground, as well as the wavelength and polarisation at which the SAR system is operating (Moreira, et al., 2013).
SAR wavelengths have letter designations that herald from their military heritage (Moreira, et al., 2013). The range of wavelengths used spans from short wavelength X-band ( = 2.5-4 cm) to the longest wavelength available for spaceborne SAR systems P-band ( = 60-120 cm) (Table 1).
Microwave polarisation is defined as the direction in which the electric field vector oscillates in space. SAR systems emit, most commonly, polarised microwaves either in the vertical direction (V) or horizontal direction (H) (Lee & Pottier, 2009; Cloude, 2010). The returned signal is also a polarised microwave, but its properties are changed by the interaction with the target, and it can be, for instance, rotated and be neither purely in the linear horizontal or vertical configuration.
The satellite receiver with the two antennae measures the returned wave in the H and V direction, thus producing a representation in an orthogonal basis (Lee & Pottier, 2009). To make this representation complete, that is, to allow for the reconstruction of any polarisation configuration, the amplitude and phases of all the combinations of the measurements in the two bases must be performed, and combined in a matrix called the scattering matrix.
Complete measurement of the scattering matrix (called SAR fully polarimetric mode) affords the distinctive capability of polarimetric SAR to be sensitive to object shapes, symmetries and orientations (Lee & Pottier, 2009). When the information richness, and cost, of the full scattering matrix are dispensable, the returned power in selected polarisation combinations is commonly used (e.g. HH, VV and HV) (Lee & Pottier, 2009).
Interaction with vegetation components is similar to the SAR system wavelength thus, long wavelength P-band will interact with the largest vegetation components (e.g. trunk and large branches), while the shorter wavelength X-band will interact will the smallest vegetation components (e.g. twigs and small branches) and the orientation of the vegetation elements that are of similar orientation in comparison to the incoming signal polarisation (Fung, 1994). Details related to underlying theory, principles and concepts of SAR systems are outside the scope of this chapter and can be found in (Woodhouse, 2005; Bamler, 2000).
Figure 2a and Figure 2b illustrate the different information that can be retrieved from SAR systems operating at different wavelengths (C-band ENVISAT ASAR and L-band ALOS PALSAR) and polarisation (VV and HV polarisation for ENVISAT ASAR and ALOS PALSAR respectively). Better discrimination can be noted between forest (grey) and bare soil/agriculture (black) using ALOS PALSAR (longer wavelength). This is because L-band penetrates deeper into the forest canopy and is more sensitive to taller vegetation through the interaction with the larger tree components (e.g. large branches), while smaller tree components, such as leaves, tend to become in the limit transparent to the radiation. Instead, at C-band backscatter saturates at lower biomass, which results in low contrast between forest and agriculture; while, hard point targets, as in the urban area (white), give higher return with respect to L-band.
